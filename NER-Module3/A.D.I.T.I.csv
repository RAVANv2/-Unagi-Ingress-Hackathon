"My ds3 is diagnosed autistic. I think 30 years ago he would have been labelled [retarded](A_behavioural) or slow. I have a cousin who is very similar to ds3 and that is his dx.
Ds3 also has birth defects and we took part in the study that made the link between bd and living near a landfill. I also have concerns over the [over use](A_behavioural) of antibiotics, my ds is [allergic](A_behavioural) to penicillin and had masses of antibiotics at the age of one.
Better dx of asd is also a factor imo. We have many children at my sons schools with asd dx that have more subtle needs and are not say at the level where they would need a statement of sen.

"I can remember distinctly at the age of 6 or 7 [not knowing](A_behavioural) how to join in a game of baseball. I wonder if I was slightly autistic. I just didnt know or ""get"" what the rules were or why, and why i was being picked for a team. Further I remember [stabbing](A_intensity) a little girl with a pencil in her hand yeah, i know, [awful](A_behavioural) but i was only six. I didnt give it a moments notice. Also my sister always had to [make friends](A_behavioural) for me when we were young. I would say, go and make friends with that little girl.",""
"I had some very slight concerns before but i'm not too sure and to me he doesn't seem that bad that he would seem that different to children of the same age. There are probably two things that he does that are more [unusual](A_behavioural) and the other things i think aren't unusual for a toddler of his age- such as not yet potty trained, not always responding to name etc. The more unusual things he does is being very good with numbers and humming although he does this much less now than he used to, oh and he also likes routine.",""
"At that age the 3 things that really struck me were [not responding](A_behavioural) to his name, [not pointing](A_behavioural), & [not waving](A_behavioural).
He also did [not speak](A_behavioural). When he was 2&1/2 I read a helpful book by Dr Lorna Wing, which details many of the signs of autism & helped me realize that's what was wrong.",""
"He is now 9.5 months old and I think clearly autistic. I am no doctor but if anyone has been through this process you become an expert of sorts.
What have I/we noticed...
Name recognition - He is [not responding](A_behavioural) to his name probably half of the time. Sometimes you can be [really loud](A_vocal) and right next to him and nothing.
[Resistance](A_intensity) to touch - He [hates](A_intensity) to be held, [pushing](A_intensity) away if you hold him close.
Head wobble/shake - He's recently developed this [head shaking](A_behavioural) movement which he does in his walker or when sitting watching TV. This was the straw that broke our back and we couldn't hide from it anymore.

"Youngest is 4.5 and gotten [worse](A_intensity) and [harder](A_intensity) to manage and has [limited speech](A_vocal). 7 year old has gotten easier.

"My daughter has autism. She's 6. The only way I can describe it and I know it comes across as [horrible](A_intensity) but it's like having a toddler who has the strenght of a 6 years old. She [throws](A_intensity) herself on the floor. Has tantrums. Is [vicious](A_intensity) towards her younger siblings. Crys [hysterically](A_intensity) if something happens that she doesn't like. Can be as easy as not getting a toy from the shop for example. She's very able in other ways and can read and write, but has [low](A_intensity) receptive communication. I just find it's getting harder, everyone told me it would get easier as she gets older but it hasn't. It's got much [worse](A_intensity). When she was little if she was having a tantrum I could pick her up or put her in the pram. Now she's too big for me to even restrain her and throws herself on the floor [screaming](A_intensity). People look at us and laugh. I've heard it. Yesterday I was banned from a shop due to her behaviour, despite me explaining her condition they didn't care/understand. I've just been pulled up by the school this morning to say she was climbing the book shelves yesterday and bit a member of staff. It really isn't going to get better is it? Every day feels like a [struggle](A_intensity) I just don't know what the future holds.",""
"we gave him more space and a people free area if his own, his behaviour changed. Massive improvement, more reasonable etc. When he needs us he knows where we are and our conversations became with him rather than at him. Sounds stupid I know but in his case he just [needed space](A_behavioural) and it's done him the world if good.",""
"My DS (5) was diagnosed a year or so ago. He is almost completely [non-verbal](A_vocal), not potty trained and [not looking](A_behavioural) like he will be for a while if at all, has to go to a special school and [doesn't really interact](A_vocal) with anyone much.

He also thinks he has social [anxiety](A_behavioural), and ADD ",""
"He has always been able to hold down a job but he really struggles with time management, deadlines, communication, prioritising multiple tasks, etc. Currently he’s going through a bit of a crisis as he’s [struggling](A_intensity) with a couple of projects he’s supposed to be managing where these issues are coming to the fore. His colleagues are getting riled and his boss is making comments about his lack of productivity and progress. This leads him into a downward spiral into [depression](A_behavioural) and [anxiety](A_behavioural). He’s actively looking for a new job.",""
"I was diagnosed a couple of years ago (I’m mid 30s). For me, the main thing has been understanding myself better. I’m far kinder to myself now. I understand why I am like I am. I try to embrace it rather than fight against it. I recognise when I need to push myself to socialise but give myself permission to rest if I’m [fatigued](A_behavioural). I’ve disclosed at job interviews to ensure I get an interview if I meet essential criteria. I disclosed at work although they seem to have no idea how to support me and I don’t know what to ask for confused.",""
"My doctor knows I’m autistic so adapts a little when I need it but I have no actual ongoing support, depending on where you live there might be charities that help, but none where I am. but it gives me the building blocks I needed to understand myself, before I always [pressured](A_behavioural) myself to be “normal” go to shops etc try and function like others, now I know why I [freak](A_behavioural) the fuck out in shops and no amount of trying is going to make me not autistic so I do things that make my life simpler rather then trying to fit in, online shopping, doing Tesco shopping late at night/online etc if you get me",""
