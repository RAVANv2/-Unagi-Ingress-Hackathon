## Autism Detection Intelligence

#### The project is an Intelligence system that can be used to automate diagnosis of Autism. 

#### Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. There are no proper medical tests to diagnose Autism. The doctor has to monitor the patient over a period of time, monitoring their behavior to conclude.

#### This system aids parents/guardian to diagnose their children, with the help of the information provided by them.

### The Detection system has 4 modules

#### Module 1 - Image classification
#### Module 2 - Predictive Analysis
#### Module 3 - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
#### Module 4 - BERT
